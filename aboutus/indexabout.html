		<p>Marcia Pantic is a foreign language and ESL teacher with many years of experience teaching adults. From research data and her experience, people who begin studying as young children are more successful in learning a language compared to those that begin as an adult. Her passion for teaching, foreign languages, and people inspired her to start a nonprofit organization called Parlamerica which addresses the language learning gap by teaching children in elementary school rather than later in high school. At the elementary school level, the number of language schools available for students is very limited and fee based. Foreign language programs offered in elementary schools are mainly before or after school programs along with a few bilingual and immersion schools in a few school districts. Most elementary age children have very limited opportunities to learn a foreign language because of the lack of foreign language instruction for children at that age or the lack of funds.</p>
